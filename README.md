**Editing Percent:**

Files containing a list of changes found in the aligned reads, for each combination of nucleotide in the reference miRNA database, and nucleotide found in the sequencing.

**Gene Counts and Differential Expression:**

Plots and tables of the differential expression analysis done using BISEK. Also contains the gene counts created from alignment of the sequenced mirna to the reference miRNA database

**Utility:**

Utility functions used in generation of edit percents and alignment data

**Generate_Edit_Counts_And_Percents.py:**

Code written to get edit counts and percents from aligned files.

**mirna_pipeline.py:**

Alignment of read libraries to reference, pileup generation, genecount generation
